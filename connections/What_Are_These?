One of the fundamental ideas of cyber security is separation of privilge.
These 3 php scripts contain functions that return a php PDO which is an interface to 
interact with our mysql server.

user privilege is anyone who has acess to the website (i.e. anyone on the internet)
	as a result they are only allowed to access the user table to call the verifyLogin mysql function.

employee privilege is anyone who logs in with valid login credentials

admin privilege is obviously admins ...
