These are mysql dumps, files that store information about the database
schema.sql is a dump of all database tables and the data stored in them
datalessSchema.sql is a dump of just the tables, no data
routines.sql is a dump of the routines, i.e. stored procedures and functions
user_table_dump.sql holds information about the mysql user accounts we used
during developmnet, i.e. user, employee, and admin (mentor)
note, that user_table_dump does not transfer grants, for this reason ther is 
a grants directory containing mysql scripts that contain the grants for 
each user we used during development
