The following assumes the endpoint is a running ubuntu server 16.04
and is equipped with the following
1. Apache web server
2. PHP 7.0 or later
3. MySql 8.0

The following steps must be followed to launch the software

1.
create 3 mysql user accounts

create user 'user'@'localhost' identified by 'passwordgoeshere'
create user 'employee'@'localhost' identified by 'passwordgoeshere'
create user 'admin'@'localhost' identified by 'passwordgoeshere'

store these passwords in a secure location, you will need them later

2. 
Download all source files from github or other means.
mv all source files in /var/www/html to the systemns /html file

3. run the following sed script to replace all occurences of the development ip , with the production ip
*note this script should be executed in the /var/www/html directory since it recursively
replaces all occurences below the root
find . -type f -name "*.php" -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i'' -e 's/devip/productionip/g'

4.
create a MySQL databse called 'Asrcoo'

create Database Asrcoo;

5.
import the dataless schema : file located at mysqlData/datalessSchema.sql

mysql -u root -p Asrcoo < datalessSchema.sql

6.
import the procedures : file located at mysqlData/routines.sql

mysql -u root -p Asrcoo < routines.sql

7. 
run the grant scripts for each user account : files located at mysqlData/grants/t

mysql -h localhost -u root -p Asrcoo < admin_grants.sql
mysql -h localhost -u root -p Asrcoo < user_grants.sql
mysql -h localhost -u root -p Asrcoo < employee_grants.sql

8.
change the passwords for the scripts in the directory connections
