Dumping the user and there grants is not trivial through mysqldump, so I had to find
an alternativate method to transport all user grants generated for the development of this project

there is a mysql query 'show 'user'@'host' grants; that returns all grants, but it is not in an easy to
transport format, so we will utilize a tool from the percona toolkit -> pt-show-grants

the installtion procedure is as follows

1.download the repository

sudo apt install wget
wget https://repo.percona.com/apt/percona-release_0.1-6.$(lsb_release -sc)_all.deb

2.install the repository

sudo dpkg -i percona-release_0.1-6.$(lsb_release -sc)_all.deb

3.update apt cache and install the percona toolkit

sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install percona-toolkit

to print out all grants of a user enter
$pt-show-grants --only theUser --host localhost --user root --ask-pass
