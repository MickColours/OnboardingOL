Web server is located at, /var/www/

I changed the default landing page for the apache webserver.
By default apache2 servers index.html, but we want it to service index.ph
to achieve this result we edit the config file at
/etc/apache2/mods-enable/dir.conf
we place index.php before index.html


I changed the default serviced file to login.php (instead of index.php) to remove code duplcation and confusion.
