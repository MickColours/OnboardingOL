#php-mysql , which is the extension that allows php and mysql to communicate
#with each other does not work with the native authentication method of mysql 8 Sha-2
#Therefore it is neccessary to ensure that a users authentication plugin is set
#to something compatible, such as mysql_native_password
#Since user creation will happen often, it would behoove me to set this as the default 
#plugin.

#The Mysql documentation specifies to add the following to the my.cnf file

[mysqld]
default_authentication_plugin=mysql_native_password

#However this file can be located in various places, and there is hierarchy of precedence that 
#determines which file ultimately dictates the method
#
#To see the order of precedence, call mysql --help
#
#To find which files actually exist on the server you can use the find or locate programs on the file
#i.e.
find my.cnf

locate my.cnf

#User info can be found in mysql.user table
#user , plugin , host , authentication_string ...

#to drop current users from the users table
drop user 'user'@'host';

flush privileges

# although % allows user to connect from any host, it does not include local
# when users are added specifies @'localhost' instead of '%'
