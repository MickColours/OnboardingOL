Roles were introduced in mySQL and amazon EC2 Ubuntu 16 instances came with
mySQL 5.4

As a result it was necessary to uninstall mysql5.4 server and client

>sudo apt-get remove --purge mysql-common* mysql-client* mysql-server*


Add MYSQL APT repository
>wget https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql-apt-config_0.8.10-1_all.deb

>dpkg -i mysql-apt-config_0.8.10-1_all.deb

Then update the repo, however on ubuntu 16.04 the key for updating mysql is expired and needed to
be replaced

To show expired keys

>sudo apt-key list

To update expired keys

>apt-key adv --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys keygoeshers

To install mysql server and client

>sudo apt install mysql-server mysql-client
